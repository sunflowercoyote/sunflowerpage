          Coyote is a visual artist based in New England. His work is a
          celebration of the divine and the mundane human form; exploring themes
          of desire, identity, and transformation.<br /><br />

          Drawing inspiration from mythology, folklore, and the natural world,
          Coyote's art invites viewers to explore the liminal spaces between the
          physical and the metaphysical. Through a combination of traditional
          and digital media, they create vivid, immersive landscapes that blur
          the boundaries between reality and fantasy.<br /><br />

          A conjurer of raw, unfiltered, primal humanity, Coyote delves into the
          essence of existence, manifesting bodies unbound by shame and entwined
          in the dance of shadow and light; His art is a testament to the
          forbidden, the carnal, and the ethereal.<br /><br />
          Each stroke of the brush or line on the canvas breathes life into
          forms that defy convention: figures that twist and merge like ancient
          deities, skin glowing with the heat of desire, and eyes that pierce
          through the veil of metaphysical restraint.<br /><br /><br />
          Coyote is like a trail of smoke — a recluse who draws inspiration from
          the darkest corners of desire, who communes with entities that thrive
          in the ancient and damp spaces between worlds. Some say their work is
          a portal, a gateway to a world where the body is both sacred and
          profane, where the viewer is forced to confront their own hidden
          truths.<br /><br />
          To experience is to surrender to the primal pulse of existence, to
          stare into the abyss of your own desires and emerge forever
          changed."<br /><br />
          Always, with love.
